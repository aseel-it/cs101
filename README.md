# CS101: Introduction to Computer Science and Art of Programming

# Description

CS101 is an adopted version of Harvard’s renowned CS50, widely regarded as the best introductory computer science course in the world. This course preserves the original quality and rigor of CS50 while making it more accessible for students by providing structured support, lectures, and materials in Dari and Pashto. You'll learn essential programming and problem-solving skills, all with guidance in your native language to ensure a smooth and engaging learning experience.

# 

# Expectations

You are expected to

* attend all lectures  
* solve all problem sets  
* submit all checks for understanding  
* design and implement a final project.

# Learning Objectives

Among this course’s objectives are that you learn how to:

* think more methodically;  
* program procedurally;  
* represent and process information;  
* communicate succinctly and precisely;  
* solve problems efficiently;  
* recognize patterns among problems;  
* decompose problems into parts and compose solutions thereto;  
* operate at multiple levels of abstraction;  
* separate design from implementation details;  
* infer from first principles how systems work;  
* assess the correctness, design, and style of code;  
* teach yourself new languages;  
* identify threats to privacy and security;  
* read documentation, drawing conclusions from specifications;  
* test solutions to problems, find faults, and identify corner cases;  
* describe symptoms of problems precisely and ask questions clearly; and  
* identify and quantify trade-offs among resources, particularly time and space.

Ultimately, the course aspires to provide you with a foundation for further studies in computer science and to empower you to apply computer science to problems in other domains.

# Checks for Understanding

Checks for Understanding are short assignments given after each lecture segment to help you apply and reinforce what you’ve learned. These checks will test your knowledge of the concepts covered in each part of the lecture. You are encouraged to use course materials, but you may not use external tools or the internet. If you need help, you can ask the course staff. The checks are designed to ensure you understand the material before moving on to more complex topics.

# Problem Sets

Problem sets are programming assignments that allow you to implement each week’s concepts in code.

# Final Project

The final project is your chance to create your own software using the skills you've learned in this course. Here are the key steps:

1. **Proposal**: Submit your project idea.

2. **Status Report**: Update on your progress.

3. **Implementation**: Complete your project.

4. **Project Fair**: Present your project to the class.

You can work alone or in a group of up to three people. Make sure your project is interesting and solves a real problem\!
